## Float Elements

Float elements are floating panels that can be triggered anywhere in the content, perfect for tooltips, additional information, or expandable content.

### Creating a Float Element:

```markdown
:::float-myid
    This is the content that will appear in the floating panel.

    You can include **any markdown** here, including:
    - Lists
    - Images
    - Code blocks
    - etc.
:::
```

### Triggering the Float Element:

Use the syntax `(?=id)` anywhere in your content to create a trigger button:

```markdown
This is some text with a question mark (?=myid) that opens more info.
```

### Features:
- Click trigger to open/close
- Click close button (√ó) to dismiss
- Click outside to close
- Multiple float elements per page
- Supports full markdown inside

### Complete Example:

```markdown
    # My Article

    This is a paragraph with more information available (?=details).

    :::float-details
        ### Additional Details

        Here's some extra information that doesn't fit in the main text:
        - Point 1
        - Point 2
        - Point 3
    :::
```

:::

```markdown

## Spacing Elements

Add precise spacing to your content.

### Width Spacing:

Adds horizontal spacing:

```markdown
    Text before (w=2em) text after
```

Creates a `<div>` with the specified width.

### Height Spacing:

Adds vertical spacing:

```markdown
    Paragraph 1

    (h=3rem)

    Paragraph 2
```

Creates a `<div>` with the specified height.

### Supported Units:
- `px` - pixels
- `em` - relative to font size
- `rem` - relative to root font size
- `lh` - line height

### Examples:

```markdown
    # Add 50px horizontal space
    Before (w=50px) After

    # Add 2em vertical space
    Top paragraph

    (h=2em)

    Bottom paragraph

    # Add 1 line-height space
    Content

    (h=1lh)

    More content
```


---


## Relative navigation link

Special navigation elements that create relative links with directional movement.

### Syntax:

Put the link using:
```markdown
    [Link Name](#goto=<DIRECTION>)
```

Put where it leads (makes focus) using:
```markdown
    (go-<DIRECTION>=element-name)
```

### Available Directions:

- **`out`**: Navigate to parent element
- **`above`**: Navigate to previous sibling
- **`below`**: Navigate to next sibling
- **`in`**: Navigate to first child
- **`inl`**: Navigate to last child

### Stacking Directions:

You can chain multiple directions together:

```markdown
    # Go out twice then down
    (go-out-out-bellow=section-name)

    # Go out, then to previous sibling
    (go-out-above=header-title)

    # Enter first child
    (go-in=first-item)
```

### Examples:

```markdown
    [Navigate to parent's next sibling with](#goto=next-topic)
    See the next section (go-out-bellow=next-topic)

    [Navigate up one level then to previous](#goto=previous-section)
    Go back to previous (go-out-above=previous-section)

    [Navigate to first child of next sibling](#goto=item-list)
    Check the first item (go-bellow-in=item-list)
```

## Additional Notes

### Nesting Blocks:

Most blocks support nesting. Common patterns:

```markdown
# Grid inside Note
:::note
    Important grid layout:
    :::grid cols-2 gap-2
        Item 1
        ---
        Item 2
    :::
:::

# Connector inside Grid
:::grid cols-2
    :::connector
        - File 1
        - File 2
    :::
    ---
    Other content
:::

# Details with Float triggers
:::details More Information
    Click here for details (?=extra-info)

    :::float-extra-info
        Even more detailed information
    :::
:::
```

### Indentation:

The system automatically removes common indentation from block content, so you can indent for readability in your source files without affecting the output.
In some cases, such as lists and connectors within lists, indentation is mandatory for correct operation.

### Markdown Processing:

All block contents are processed for markdown, so you can use:
- **Bold**, *italic*, `code`
- Lists and sublists
- Links and images
- Code blocks
- Other custom blocks

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Use semantic names**: When creating float IDs or navigation targets, use descriptive names like `detailed-explanation` instead of `float1`.

2. **Grid responsiveness**: For mobile-friendly layouts, use `responsive` and `auto-fit` options with reasonable `min-` values.

3. **Callout usage**: Use `:::note` for helpful information and `:::warning` for critical warnings or potential issues.

4. **Spacing consistency**: Use `rem` or `em` units for spacing to maintain consistency with your design system.

5. **Navigation links**: Test your navigation links thoroughly as they depend on the rendered HTML structure.

6. **Float elements position**: Float elements work best with short, clickable trigger text. Don't overuse them in a single paragraph.
