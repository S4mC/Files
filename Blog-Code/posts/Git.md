## Configuring green`origin` and green`upstream` in Git

When working with a forked repository, you should configure two remotes:

- **origin** → your fork (where you push your commits).
- **upstream** → the original repository (where you fetch updates).

### How to set the remotes

1. Set **origin** to your fork:
	```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git
	```
2. Set upstream to the original repository:
```bash
git remote set-url upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/REPO-NAME.git
```
3. Verify the configuration:
```bash
git remote -v
```
	Example output:
```powershell
origin    https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/REPO-NAME.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/REPO-NAME.git (push)
```

5. With this setup:
	- bash`git push` --> sends commits to your fork (origin).
	- bash`git fetch upstream` + bash`git merge upstream/main` --> brings changes from the original repo.

## Configuring default editor
You can define which editor will open by default when Git needs you to edit a commit message or configuration.

- VSCode:
	```bash
		git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
	```

- Codium:
	```bash
		git config --global core.editor "codium --wait"
	```

## How to revert to a previous commit
You have two options: you **can delete the commits after** the one you want to return to using bash`git reset` or you can **revert the commits after** the one you want to return to using bash`git revert`

### git reset
This will delete all commits that come after the commit you want to return (The **\<commit\>** will be the header after execution), you have to run bash`git reset --hard <commit>` , for example:
```bash
	git reset --hard 579b
```
To upload the changes to github you must then use:
```bash
	git push --force
```

### git revert
Git creates a new commit that undoes (reverts) the changes introduced by a specific commit.
- If that commit added lines → revert deletes them.
- If it deleted lines → revert adds them back.
- If it modified a file → revert leaves it as it was before that commit.
- The end result is as if that commit never existed, but without deleting anything from the history.

So, just like when you use bash`git revert <commit>`, the changes generated by that commit are reverted. You can apply that command to all commits after the one you want to return and thus return to that commit without deleting the history.

To revert all commits after **\<commit\>** (It's as if the **\<commit\>** will be the header after execution)(?=revert_multiple) use:
```bash
    git revert <commit>..HEAD
```

:::float-revert_multiple
	This doesn't revert the \<commit\>, just the subsequent ones.
	If you want to revert to the previous commit of the specified commit (even reverting the specified commit), use bash`git revert <commit>^..HEAD`
